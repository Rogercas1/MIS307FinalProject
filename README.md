# MIS307FinalProject

Repo containing final group project for MIS 307
Purpose of the project was for students to showcase and utilize everything that was learned within the class

Class objectives we utilized for this project:
1. Connecting to Twitter API (Tweepy)
2. Working with JSON data
3. Using basic NLP methods to analyze sentiment and polarity
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib for basic visuals

# Project
Our team started with the idea that Wendy's is the most successful fast food company in terms of having a social media presense. After seeing them accumulate tens of thousands of likes and retweets we decided to take a look at Wendy's tweeting habits, as well as see how it's customer interacted with it. With the result being, a fast food company such as Taco Bell can view this information and find ways to fall in the footsteps of Wendy's.

# Conclusion
One of the bigger takeways we noted was that the majority of Wendy's tweets had a more positive to neutral sentiment, while we noticed Taco Bell's tweet had a neutral to negative sentiment. The ability to incorporate positive sentimented tweets, would more than likely lead to an increase of an engagement from customers. Another method which has allowed Wendy's to thrive in terms of social media marketing is their willingness to try and engage with other big name accounts.
